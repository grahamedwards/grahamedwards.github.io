title: "Early Solar System"
permalink: /research/chondrite
excerpt: "Shortly after the formation of the Sun, the first small planetary bodies, called planetesimals, formed within the collapsing primordial dust cloud and became the building blocks of the planets and asteroids in our solar system today. In my research I use the U-Pb system in phosphate minerals of ordinary chondrites to attempt to understand the thermal histories, physical properties, and timescales of formation of these primitive bodies.<br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
