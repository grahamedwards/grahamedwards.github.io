Early Solar System
======

Shortly after the formation of the Sun, the first small planetary bodies, called planetesimals, formed within the collapsing primordial dust cloud. These were the building blocks of our solar system as we know it today, yet all that we know about these many 1-100 km scal bodies is limited to the predictions of dynamical models and direct measurements derived from the heartbreakingly incomplete meteoritic record. I have use the U-Pb system in phosphate minerals of ordinary chondrites to attempt to understand the thermal histories, physical properties, and timescales of formation of these primitive bodies.
