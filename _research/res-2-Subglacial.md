excerpt: "Glaciers are a critical component of the Earth's climate system, and have drastically shaped the Earth's surface at high latitudes and elevations. I use U-series isotopes to investigate subglacial hydrologic systems of ice sheets and the timescales of glacial erosion.<br/><img src='/images/ice/Linebreen_snout.jpg'>"

Throughout the Pleistocene and Holocene, glaciers and ice sheets have served as major water reservoirs. Ice sheets have sequestered and released meters to many tens of meters of sea level on 100-thousand to million year timescales. While the behavior of glaciers reciprocally controls and is controlled by the climate system, the responses of ice masses to these climate forcings are strongly modulated by processes at the glacier bases. In these basal and subglacial regions, the ice mass interacts with sediments and waters that affect the dynamics of the overlying ice sheet.

U-series radionuclides have proven to be important tracers of aqueous and sedimentary processes on Pleistocene timescales. In my research, I aim to harness these capabilities of these radionuclides to infer subglacial hydrologic processes beneath ice sheets and measure the timescales of glacial erosion.

### Comminution
Glaciers are dynamic systems that wear away at the very land they sit on. This is because the ice of glaciers literally flows, albeit slowly, under its own weight. At the base of glaciers, pieces of rock are entrained in the ice and dragged along the ground, or “bed,” scraping and gouging bedrock as the ice flows. Processes like this occurring at or near the bed of a glacier grinds, wears, and otherwise breaks down, or __*comminutes*__, the bedrock and subglacial sediment. In these fine particles, the recoil experienced by U-series nuclides during α-decay can result in ejection of daughter nuclides from particles. This process of α-recoil ejection forms the basis of comminution dating, as originally proposed by [DePaolo and others (2006)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2006.06.004). For an overview of U-series geochemistry and a summary of comminution dating,  [go here](grahamedwards.github.io/research/u-comm).

U-series comminution dating, while a challenging technique fraught with complications, offers a unique chronometric tool for understanding the timescales of erosive processes. I have been using U-series comminution techniques to constrain the timing of sediment comminution in Taylor Valley, Antarctica (above). Glacial drift deposits in Taylor Valley reflect ongoing sediment transport through the Pleistocene, while landscape evolution models for the West Antarctic McMurdo Dry Valleys invoke limited erosion over the last >10 million years. My research seeks to resolve whether Taylor Glacier has been actively comminuting sediments, and therefore likely incising the valley, during the Pleistocene. Excitingly, the U-series compositions of Taylor Valley silts (collected in the 2017 austral spring) imply ongoing erosion and a much more dynamic erosion history than previously thought! I am currently finishing data collection and preparing a manuscript on the results of this study. I kept a blog of our 2017 fieldwork that you can read [on my old website](https://edwardsgh.wordpress.com/blogs/taylor-valley-antarctica-2017/).

### Subglacial Waters
My interests in subglacial systems extend beyond the sediments and into the porewaters and basal ice. As U-series daughter nuclides are ejected from sediments, they accumulate in porewaters and ice. As a result of this process, hypersaline brines erupted from the snout of Taylor Glacier (below), an outlet of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, reflect <sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U compositions a factor of 5 greater than bedrock values. The U-series compositions of glacial meltwaters and products of these meltwaters can thus serve as critical measures of subglacial conditions and processes. Current work on this subject includes both isotopic measurements of subglacially formed waterlain precipitates as well as isotopic chemical models of subglacial and periglacial systems.
