We combine U-Pb thermochronology of rutile and apatite from middle-to-lower crustal xenoliths form an Attawapiskat kimberlite with paired crustal thermal and Pb-production diffusion models to ascertain the timescales of plume heating beneath the Superior Craton in midwestern Canada. <i>Thermochronologic data are best fit by model simulations in which the Attawapiskat lithosphere experienced a ca. 1.1 Ga heating event triggered by partial lithosphere removal and mantle temperatures >200 °C in excess of that of ambient mantle, consistent with a model of ∼100 m.y. plume head residence beneath the Attawapiskat region.</i>
