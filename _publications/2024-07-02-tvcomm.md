title: "Uranium-series isotopes as tracers of physical and chemical weathering in glacial sediments from Taylor Valley, Antarctica"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/tvcomm24
excerpt: 'Uranium series isotopes are sensitive tracers of both chemical and physical weathering. We report U-series data from fine-grained sediments form Taylor Valley, Antarctica that were deposited over the course of the last million years. Using novel numerical techniques we interpret the coupled chemical-physical weathering histories and show that Taylor Glacier has been eroding into Taylor Valley over the course of the Pleistocene.'
