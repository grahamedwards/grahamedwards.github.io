title: "An early giant planet instability recorded in asteroidal meteorites"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/gpm23
excerpt: 'We use a Bayesian statistical code to constrain the timescales of giant planet migration and asteroid belt bombardment in the early solar system. Our results associate giant planet migration with the dissipation of the gaseous protoplanetary disk.
