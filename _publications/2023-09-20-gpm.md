title: "An early giant planet instability recorded in asteroidal meteorites"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/gpm23
excerpt: 'We use a Bayesian statistical code to constrain the timescales of giant planet migration and asteroid belt bombardment in the early solar system. Our results associate giant planet migration with the dissipation of the gaseous protoplanetary disk. 
<br>
I was invited to write a more broadly accessible [Research Briefing](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41550-024-02341-5) that summarizes the relevance and main conclusions of our study.
<br>
The preprint was also summarized by [Astrobites](https://astrobites.org/2023/09/25/meteorites-planet-migration/), and I was quoted in two recent articles on the topic of giant planet migration in [*Science Magazine*](https://www.science.org/content/article/giant-planets-ran-amok-soon-after-solar-system-s-birth) and [*Sky & Telescope*](https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/meteorites-tighten-timeline-for-giant-planets-movement-through-the-solar-system/).'
