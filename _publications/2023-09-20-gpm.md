title: "An early giant planet instability recorded in asteroidal meteorites"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/gpm23
excerpt: 'We use a Bayesian statistical code to constrain the timescales of giant planet migration and asteroid belt bombardment in the early solar system from meteorite thermochronology. We identify a bombardment event beginning ~11 million years after the Sun formed, associating giant planet migration with the dissipation of the gaseous protoplanetary disk.'
