I am an Assistant Professor of Earth and Environmental Geosciences and PI of the <em>Geochemistry & Radioisotope Analysis & Computation Laboratory</em> ([GRACkLe](https://grackletu.github.io)) at [Trinity University](https://www.trinity.edu/academics/departments/geosciences). My research spans the fields of geochemistry, cosmochemistry, and geochronology. 

## Research Topics

**Ice Sheets** have intermittently covered northern hemisphere landmasses over the last several million years. I study subglacial systems with isotope geochemistry and U-series geochronology to reconstruct the behavior and life cycles of glaciers and ice sheets.

<em>Latest glacial:</em> [Paper on Laurentide Ice Sheet groundwaters & ice streaming](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abp9329).

**Metorites** are relics from the dawn of our solar system and offer a glimpse of the Sun and planets' formation. I study meteorites with computational and laboratory methods to reconstruct solar system history and contextualize it among other exoplanetary systems.

<em>Latest celestial:</em> Giant planet migration is in the news! I was interviewed for two articles ([one in Science Magazine](https://www.science.org/content/article/giant-planets-ran-amok-soon-after-solar-system-s-birth), and [another in Sky & Telescope](https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/meteorites-tighten-timeline-for-giant-planets-movement-through-the-solar-system/)) based on my own [recent work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10906) on the topic.

**Soils** evolve through a complex combination of physical and chemical processes. I am interested in applying geochemical techniques to examine weathering and pedogenesis, or soil formation.
