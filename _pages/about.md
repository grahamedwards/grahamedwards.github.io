I am an NSF Astronomy & Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellow at Dartmouth College.

My research spans the fields of cosmochemistry, isotope geochemistry, and geochronology. 

**Metorites** are relics from the dawn of our solar system and offer a glimpse into the primordial processes that formed the planets and Sun. I use computational, chemical, and geochronologic methods to reconstruct solar system history at a high-resolution from the meteorite record. I am particularly interested in contextualizing our solar system among other "extrasolar" stars and planetary systems.

**Ice Sheets** have intermittently covered the landmasses of the northern hemisphere over the last several million years. I study subglacial systems with isotope geochemistry and U-series geochronology to better understand the behavior and life cycles of glaciers and ice sheets.

**PhD Research**: As a doctoral student in the [Blackburn Lab](https://ucscgeochronology.sites.ucsc.edu/) at UC Santa Cruz, I used radioactive isotopes of uranium and their intermediate and stable daughter products to answer questions about 1) [the interplay between glaciers and their environments](../_research/res-2-Subglacial.md),  2) [the timescales and processes of planetary assembly in the early solar system](../_research/res-3-chondrite.md), and 3) [billion-year timescales of middle crustal cooling and reheating](../_research/res-4-thermochron.md).

I am committed to accessible and engaging education, within and beyond classrooms. Museums provide unique opportunities for poignant, immersive, and even dynamic educational experiences.  I am currently developing outreach programming with the [Montshire Museum of Science](https://www.montshire.org/) as a part of my postdoctoral work, and I continue to co-host [monthly video streams](https://www.santacruzmuseum.org/category/rockin-pop-up/) about Earth sciences with [Gavin Piccione](https://gavinpiccione.github.io/) and the Santa Cruz Museum of Natural History.
