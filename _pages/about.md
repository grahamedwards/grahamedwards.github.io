I am an Assistant Professor of Earth and Environmental Geosciences and PI of the <em>Geochemistry & Radioisotope Analysis & Computation Laboratory</em> ([GRACkLe](https://grackletu.github.io)) at [Trinity University](https://www.trinity.edu/academics/departments/geosciences). My research spans the fields of geochemistry, cosmochemistry, and geochronology. 

## Research Topics

**Ice Sheets** have intermittently covered northern hemisphere landmasses over the last several million years. I study subglacial systems with isotope geochemistry and U-series geochronology to reconstruct the behavior and life cycles of glaciers and ice sheets.

**Metorites** are relics from the dawn of our solar system and offer a glimpse of the Sun and planets' formation. I study meteorites with computational and laboratory methods to reconstruct solar system history and contextualize it among other exoplanetary systems.

**Soils** evolve through a complex combination of physical and chemical processes. I apply geochemical techniques to examine weathering and pedogenesis (soil formation).
