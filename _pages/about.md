Radioactive decay has paced like a metronome in the background of our solar system's 4.5-billion year history. Applying principles of isotope geochemistry, I use these natural atomic clocks to measure the tempos of processes in the early solar system and during Earth's glacial climates.

I am currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of California Santa Cruz, working in the [Blackburn Lab Group](https://ucscgeochronology.sites.ucsc.edu/). My PhD research has focused on using the radioactive isotopes of uranium and its intermediate and final daughter products to answer questions about 1) billion-year timescales of middle crustal cooling and reheating, 2) the timescales and processes of planetary assembly in the early solar system, and 3) the interplay between glaciers and their environments.
