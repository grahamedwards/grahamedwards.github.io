I am an NSF Astronomy & Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellow at Dartmouth College.

My research spans the fields of cosmochemistry, isotope geochemistry, and geochronology. 

**Metorites** are relics from the dawn of our solar system and offer a glimpse into the primordial processes that formed the planets and Sun. I use computational, chemical, and geochronologic methods to reconstruct solar system history at a high-resolution from the meteorite record. I am particularly interested in using these new insights from our solar system to inform models of extrasolar systems -- stars and the planets that orbit them.

**Ice Sheets** have intermittently covered the landmasses of the northern hemisphere over the last several million years. I use isotope geochemistry and U-series geochronology to study processes at the bases of glaciers to better understand the behavior and life cycles of glaciers and ice sheets.

**PhD Research**: As a doctoral student in the [Blackburn Lab](https://ucscgeochronology.sites.ucsc.edu/) at UC Santa Cruz, I used radioactive isotopes of uranium and their intermediate and stable daughter products to answer questions about 1) [the interplay between glaciers and their environments](../_research/res-1-Subglacial.md),  2) [the timescales and processes of planetary assembly and thermal processing in the early solar system](../_research/res-2-chondrite.md), and 3) [billion-year timescales of middle crustal cooling and reheating](res-3-thermochron.md).

In addition to my research interests, I am passionate about accessible education, especially via museums. Museums and exhibit spaces provide unique opportunities for poignant, immersive, and even dynamic educational experiences. Prior to beginning my graduate studies, I  worked at the Peary-MacMillan Arctic Museum (Brunswick, Maine) and volunteered at the Museum of the Rockies (Bozeman, Montana). I currently volunteer with my labmate and colleague [Gavin Piccione](https://gavinpiccione.github.io/) at the Santa Cruz Museum of Natural History, where host [monthly video streams](https://www.santacruzmuseum.org/category/rockin-pop-up/) about Earth sciences.
