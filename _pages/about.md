~ WEBSITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION. PLEASE PARDON INCOMPLETENESS ~
I'll be working on completing this website and bringing it into final form over the course of 2020. Thanks for visiting!

Radioactive decay has paced like a metronome in the background of our solar system's 4.5-billion year history. Applying principles of isotope geochemistry, I use the natural atomic clocks of radiometric systems to measure the tempos of processes in the early solar system and during Earth's glacial climates.

I am currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of California Santa Cruz, working in the [Blackburn Lab](https://ucscgeochronology.sites.ucsc.edu/). My PhD research has focused on using the radioactive isotopes of uranium and its intermediate and stable daughter products to answer questions about 1) billion-year timescales of middle crustal cooling and reheating, 2) the timescales and processes of planetary assembly and thermal processing in the early solar system, and 3) the interplay between glaciers and their environments.
