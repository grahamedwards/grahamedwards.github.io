Thank you for visiting my academic website. I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of California Santa Cruz, working in the [Blackburn Lab Group](https://ucscgeochronology.sites.ucsc.edu/). My research utilizes the radioactive isotopes of uranium and its intermediate and final daughter products to answer questions about 1) the timescales and processes of planetary assembly in the early solar system and 2) the interplay between glaciers and their environments.

#Radioactive decay has served as a metronome pacing in the background of Earth and our solar system's >4.5 billion year history. Applying principles of isotope geochemistry, I am interested using the products of these natural clocks to measure the tempos of processes during this 4.5 billion year history. Over the course of
