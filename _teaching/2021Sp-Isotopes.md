Radiogenic and stable isotope geochemistry: isotopic systems and their applications in the Earth sciences. <br><b>Instructors:</b> Profs. Terrence Blackburn and Jim Zachos.

### Responsibilities
Script, record, and produce five 10-20 minute videos demonstrating isotope geochemistry laboratory methods and narrating the progression of a geochemical study.
Collected isotope data for students to interpret in final project. (Remote Instruction)

### Topics Covered
Rock sample preparation, including wet chemistry methods (sample digestion and ion-exchange column chemistry), fundamentals of mass spectrometry, and various isotopic analysis methods:
  carbonate &delta<sup>13</sup>C and &delta<sup>18</sup>O by iRMS,
  organic C and N amount and &delta<sup>13/sup>C and &delta<sup>15/sup>N by CN-EA-iRMS
  water isotope (&deltaD, &delta<sup>17</sup>O, &delta<sup>18</sup>O) by laser analyzer,
  carbonate <sup>87/sup>Sr/<sup>86/sup>Sr by TIMS,
  and carbonate <sup>230/sup>Th-<sup>232/sup>Th-<sup>234/sup>U-<sup>238/sup>U by ID-TIMS.
