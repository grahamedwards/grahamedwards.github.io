While I was a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz, I volunteered as a guest geologist at the [Santa Cruz Museum of Natural Histor](https://www.santacruzmuseum.org/) with my colleague, labmate, and friend, [Gavin Piccione](https://gavinpiccione.github.io/).
As the <i>Geology Gents</i>, we identified rocks and shared out knowledge of Earth processes and history with the Santa Cruz community at museum events and monthly "Rockin' Pop-ups".
In the spring of 2020, when shelter-in-place orders were declared in Santa Cruz, we transitioned to a virtual format, regularly broadcasting geoscience content through the museum.

If you're interested, check out our [Virtual Rockin' Pop-ups](https://www.santacruzmuseum.org/category/rockin-pop-up/) and [Rock Record Blog](https://www.santacruzmuseum.org/category/virtual-museum/rock-record/).

Over the course of 4 years, we had a blast talking about rocks and enjoyed many wonderful conversations with community members. 
Shortly after transitioning into my post-doc we had our final virtual Rockin' Pop-ups. 
Currently, we have been looking back at the program and hope to share 
We presented our first insights at Earth Educators' Rendezvous 2022.
