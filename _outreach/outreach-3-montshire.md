As part of my postdoctoral work, I am developing programming focused on meteorites, asteroids, and the solar system...

I recently developed a new meteorite identification key for their "Meteorites!" activity:

I am piloting a new program called "<i>A Journey to Jupiter</i>" — a 15-30 minute walk along the Montshire Museum's Planet Trail, where we walk from the Sun to Jupiter, using meteorites to help understand the history of our star and its rocky planets.
